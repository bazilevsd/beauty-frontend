# Beauty Web site

# About the project
The project has separate repositories for front and back end. Backend is express and MongoDB (Mongoose) written in TypeScript. Frontend is Vite written in TypeScript. 
The project inspired by my friend's profession and her need in good scheduling component. That part is custom build of the tutorial by Nevo David:
https://novu.co/blog/creating-a-scheduling-app-with-react-nodejs-and-emailjs/
and using EmailJS as submission portion. 
I am planing on continuing working and researching more optimal scheduling options.
The log in portion for site is written and can be easy implemented by adding "ensureLogedIn" component to route path in backend.
